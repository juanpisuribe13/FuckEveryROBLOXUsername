# FuckEveryROBLOXUsername
 Python script where it tweets every minute fuck along with a random ROBLOX username obtained from ROBLOX's API.
 
# To set it up:
1. Download the latest release from:
2. Extract it in a folder of your choice.
3. Open up a terminal, go to the folder where you extracted it in, then create a virtual environment in the same folder ("python3 -m venv feru_env"; you can change feru_env to the name of your choice.)  
4. Activate the virtual environment by typing in "source feru_env/bin/activate", or if you're using Windows "feru_env/Scripts/activate.bat". If your virtual environment's name isn't feru_env, change it to the name you put it in while typing the command. Remember to activate this IN the same folder where you extracted the latest release AND where you created the virtual environment.
5. [TODO] (also hi if you're reading this from the future)
